Vector training is a cutting-edge method to enhance your chatbot's capabilities by transforming textual data from documents into vector embeddings. These embeddings can be used by the chatbot to understand context, answer questions, and provide more accurate responses based on the content of the documents. This guide will walk you through the process of using our platform to train your chatbot using vector embeddings.

## Add Your Data

### 1. Uploading PDFs

Start by uploading the PDFs that contain the information you want your chatbot to learn from. These can be manuals, FAQs, product descriptions, or any other relevant documents.

- Navigate to the **Files** section.
- Click on the **Add Files** button, represented by a plus icon next to a document.
- Select the PDFs from your device and upload them. Once uploaded, they will be securely stored and displayed in the **Files Table**.

### 2. Selecting Files for Training

Before training the chatbot, you need to select which files you want to use:

- In the **Files Table**, you'll see a list of all the uploaded files.
- To select a file, click on the checkbox next to its name. To select all files, click on the checkbox in the table header.
- You can view a file by clicking on the **View** link next to its name or delete it using the **Delete** button.

### 3. Training the Chatbot

Once you've selected the desired files:

- Choose the chatbot you want to train from the dropdown menu at the top of the **Files Table**.
- Click on the **Train AI Model** button.
- The platform will automatically transform the selected files into embeddings (vectors) and store them in a secure, high-availability vector database.
- Your chatbot will now use this data in its conversations, enhancing its understanding and response accuracy.

### 4. Safety and Security

- All uploaded files are stored securely, ensuring data privacy.
- The vector database is designed for high availability, ensuring that the chatbot can access the embeddings whenever needed.

### 5. Enhancing Chatbot Conversations

By using vector embeddings, your chatbot can:

- Understand context from the documents.
- Answer questions based on the content of the documents.
- Provide more accurate and relevant responses.
