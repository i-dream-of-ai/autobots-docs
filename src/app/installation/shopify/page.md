## Integrating Autobots AI Chatbot with Shopify

Follow the steps below for a robust integration of the Autobots AI chatbot into your Shopify store:

#### 1. **Log in to Your Shopify Admin Panel**
- Navigate to your Shopify store's admin URL (typically `yourstorename.myshopify.com/admin`).
- Enter your login credentials.

#### 2. **Navigate to Settings**
- In the bottom left corner of the dashboard, click on 'Settings'.

#### 3. **Access the Checkout Settings**
- From the Settings page, click on 'Checkout'.

#### 4. **Embed the Script in the Additional Scripts Section**
- Scroll down to the "Order processing" section.
- In the "Additional scripts" box, paste your Autobots AI chatbot script. This ensures the chatbot will appear on the checkout pages, which are crucial for customer interactions.

#### 5. **Save Changes**
- Click the 'Save' button at the top right to apply your changes.

#### 6. **For Non-Checkout Pages**
If you want the chatbot to appear on all pages, not just the checkout:

- Go to 'Online Store' > 'Themes'.
- Click on 'Customize' for the theme you're using.
- Add a new section or modify an existing one to include an HTML section, and paste the chatbot script there.

#### 7. **Verify the Integration**
- Browse your Shopify store to ensure the Autobots AI chatbot widget appears on both checkout and other pages.
